                <p>Philip Alfred Mickelson, nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer. He has won 45 events on the PGA Tour, including six major championships: three Masters titles, two PGA Championships, and one Open Championship.Phil turned professional at the 1992 U.S. Open and played 10 more events that season. He opened the next year, though, with a win in the inaugural Buick Invitational on Torrey Pines South, a municipal course where he played his high school matches. Phil was a stroke behind Dave Rummells after nine holes but made five birdies coming in and won by four. He kept the check but also won a car, which he promptly gave to his mother. She’s since switched vehicles but still uses the original license plate, FOREMA. Phil’s next Buick victory meant a car for Dad, whose plate reads THXSON. Phil has been with the team for 4 years now.</p>
