                    <h3>Building Character</h3>
                    <p class="home-par" id="top-par">
                        Part of the challenge of golf is that it can be frustrating at times. However, we see this as an opportunity to build character. When you miss a putt or land in the sand trap for the third time, you have a choice to make. You can get upset which will likely make your game even worse, or you can take a deep breath and recognize that sometimes, life doesn't go as planned. In those quiet moments out on the course, you also have the chance to see the bigger picture. Maybe you don't need to get so upset when your children make a mess in your home office or when your secretary forgets to make you copies. And here at Scratch Golf we aim to reinforce that idea. It's important to be mentaly tough not just on the golf course, but in your day to day life.
